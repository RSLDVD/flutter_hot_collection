This Flutter code showcases the usage of the `Scaffold` widget and related components to build a comprehensive app layout with various features. The code creates a simple app with a navigation drawer, an app bar, a body section, a floating action button, and a bottom navigation bar.

1. MaterialApp and Scaffold Setup:
The `WidgetScaffoldEx` class represents the entry point of the app. It uses the `MaterialApp` widget to set up the app with a primary blue color theme. The `ScaffoldExample` widget serves as the home screen.

2. App Bar:
Inside the `ScaffoldExample`, the `appBar` property is configured using the `AppBar` widget. The app bar includes a title ("Scaffold Example") and an actions list with an `IconButton`. The `IconButton` displays a settings icon. The `onPressed` callback for the icon button is currently empty.

3. Navigation Drawer:
The `drawer` property of the `Scaffold` is set to a `Drawer` widget. The drawer contains a `ListView` with a `DrawerHeader` and two `ListTile` widgets. The `DrawerHeader` displays a blue background with the text "Drawer Header" in white. The `ListTile` widgets represent options for "Home" and "Profile". Both options include icons (home and account circle) and `onTap` callbacks. The callbacks are currently empty but can be used to navigate to respective screens.

4. Body Content:
The `body` property of the `Scaffold` is configured with a `Center` widget. Inside the `Center`, a `Column` widget is used to organize the content vertically. The column contains:
- A `Text` widget displaying "Welcome to the Scaffold Example" with a font size of 18.
- A `SizedBox` widget for spacing.
- An `ElevatedButton` with the label "Click Me". The button has an `onPressed` callback that is currently empty.

5. Floating Action Button:
The `floatingActionButton` property of the `Scaffold` includes a `FloatingActionButton` widget. The button displays a circular icon (add icon) and has an `onPressed` callback that is currently empty.

6. Bottom Navigation Bar:
The `bottomNavigationBar` property of the `Scaffold` is set to a `BottomNavigationBar` widget. The widget contains three `BottomNavigationBarItem` widgets representing "Home", "Explore", and "Profile" options. Each item has an icon (home, explore, and person icons) and a label. The labels are "Home", "Explore", and "Profile".

This example demonstrates how to create a basic app layout using the `Scaffold` widget and various components to build an intuitive user interface. You can further customize and enhance this layout by adding functionality to the callbacks and integrating navigation between different screens.

        "This code exemplifies the usage of `StatelessWidget` and demonstrates the creation of reusable components in a Flutter app.\n\n"
        "The `WidgetStatelessEx` class is a `StatelessWidget` that illustrates how to use a `MaterialApp` widget to set up the app's title and theme. It sets the `StatelessWidgetExample` as the home page of the app.\n\n"

        "1. App Bar:\n An app bar appears at the top of the screen with the title \"StatelessWidget Example.\"\n\n"
        "2. Body:\n The main content of the app is centered using a `Center` widget. Inside this center, a `Column` is utilized to vertically arrange two components:\n"
        "- `ColoredBoxWidget`: This custom widget displays a colored box measuring 150x150 pixels. The box is blue in color, and a centered `Text` widget inside it reads \"Colored Box\" with white color and a font size of 18.\n"
        "- `RoundedButtonWidget`: This custom widget is a reusable `ElevatedButton` with rounded corners. It takes two required parameters: `buttonText` (the label for the button) and `onPressed` (the callback function to execute when the button is pressed).\n\n"
        "By using these components, the code effectively demonstrates the principles of creating reusable widgets using the `StatelessWidget` class. Each custom widget (`ColoredBoxWidget` and `RoundedButtonWidget`) encapsulates specific functionality, promoting clean and modular code design. The `StatelessWidget` class is ideal for components that don't require internal state management, making it an excellent choice for creating UI elements that can be easily composed and combined to build complex user interfaces.\n\n",

    sourceFilePath: '/widget_stateful_ex',
    description: '''
This code demonstrates the use of a `StatefulWidget` in Flutter, showcasing how to manage and update the state of a widget and its child components.

The `WidgetStatefulEx` class extends `StatefulWidget` and represents the main application page. It contains a boolean `_isHighlighted` that determines whether a colored box and a toggle button are highlighted or not. The `_toggleHighlight` method toggles this boolean state when the toggle button is pressed.

The `_StatefulWidgetExampleState` class is a state class associated with `WidgetStatefulEx`. Inside the `build` method, a `Scaffold` widget is used to set up the app's UI structure. It contains an app bar with the title "StatefulWidget Example" and a `Center` widget to vertically center the UI components.

Inside the `Center` widget, a `Column` arranges two components:
1. `ColoredBoxWidget`:\n This custom widget displays a colored box that changes color based on the `_isHighlighted` value. The color alternates between amber (highlighted) and grey (not highlighted). A `Text` widget inside the box dynamically displays "Highlighted" or "Not Highlighted" based on the `_isHighlighted` value.

2. `ToggleButtonWidget`:\n Another custom widget, this one provides a button that toggles the `_isHighlighted` state when pressed. The button label reads "Turn On" when not highlighted and "Turn Off" when highlighted.

By utilizing the `StatefulWidget` class, the code illustrates how to manage dynamic UI changes and maintain state in response to user interactions. The `_StatefulWidgetExampleState` class extends the `State` class to enable state updates using the `setState` method. When the toggle button is pressed, the state is updated, triggering a rebuild of the widget tree to reflect the changes in the UI.

This example underscores the power of `StatefulWidget` for managing complex UI states and rendering dynamic content based on user actions, making it an essential tool for creating interactive and responsive Flutter applications.

**Dynamic Iconic Grid View**

This code example demonstrates the implementation of a dynamic and visually appealing grid layout using Flutter's GridView.builder. The provided 'GridViewEx' class generates a grid of items, each comprising an icon, text, and a distinct background color. Let's delve into the details:

**Code Overview:**
The heart of this implementation lies in the 'GridView.builder' widget, which efficiently creates scrollable grid views. In this scenario, the grid displays 10 items with a fixed cross-axis count of 2, resulting in 2 columns. The layout configuration, specified by 'SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount', determines the spacing between the items.

Each grid item is encapsulated within a 'Container'. The background color of each container is dynamically generated based on the item's index, producing a visually appealing gradient-like effect. Within the container, a 'Column' widget is utilized to vertically align the icon and text components.

**Icon and Text Components:**
- A prominent 'Icon' widget is situated at the center of each grid item. The icon chosen is a star icon, boasting a size of 50 and a bright amber color scheme.
- Just beneath the icon, a 'Text' widget presents a label in the form of "Item X", where X signifies the item's index. The text is centered within the column and adheres to a font size of 16.

**Background Color Variation:**
The allure of the grid items stems from the gradient-like appearance facilitated by assigning distinctive background colors based on the index. The 'Colors.blue' palette is harnessed for this purpose, contributing to the visually pleasing aesthetic of the grid.

**Implementing the GridView:**
The 'GridView.builder' widget is pivotal for rendering the grid. It necessitates specifying the total 'itemCount' (10 in this instance) and furnishing a builder function responsible for constructing each individual item. This function receives the 'context' and 'index', affording customization based on the item's position.

**Main Function and App Structure:**
The code can be executed using the 'main' function. By initializing a 'MaterialApp', the code establishes a familiar user interface structure. The 'GridViewEx' is presented within the body of a 'Scaffold', enabling users to interactively explore the dynamic and captivating grid layout.

In summation, this code example serves as a practical demonstration of how to craft visually engaging grid layouts enriched with icons and descriptive text through the use of Flutter's 'GridView.builder'. It serves as a foundation for crafting versatile user interfaces, ranging from captivating image galleries to informative product displays.

- Subcategory A1 contains two list items (Item A1.1, Item A1.2).
- Categories B and C have individual list items (B1, B2, C1, C2).

**User Interaction:**
The ExpansionTile widgets enable users to expand and collapse categories, revealing or hiding the underlying content.

**Application Scenarios:**
This pattern is particularly useful for crafting navigation menus, content organization, or presenting data in a structured manner. It helps maintain a clutter-free UI by allowing users to access content based on their interests.

The DataTableEx class showcases the usage of the DataTable widget in Flutter, enhanced with interactive checkboxes to provide user-controlled data selection. The primary purpose of this example is to display tabular data in a readable and organized manner, allowing users to interact with each row's checkbox.

In the initState method, the code initializes the rows list, which defines the data for each row of the table. Each row is represented by a DataRow widget, and each cell within a row is represented by a DataCell widget. For the first three columns (First Name, Last Name, and Age), simple Text widgets display the data.

The fourth column, labeled "Select," contains a Checkbox widget. By utilizing the onChanged callback of the Checkbox, users can toggle the checkbox state. This interaction is managed by the setState method, which rebuilds the widget tree and updates the displayed content accordingly. When a checkbox is toggled, the corresponding DataRow cell is updated to display the new checkbox state.

The DataTable widget is enclosed in a SingleChildScrollView with horizontal scrolling, ensuring that the table remains readable even if the content exceeds the screen width.

In summary, the DataTableEx example demonstrates how to create a user-friendly table with interactive checkboxes in Flutter. This approach is useful for scenarios where users need to select or mark specific rows of data.

    description: """
The code you provided is a Flutter widget that demonstrates the use of tween animations using the AnimatedBuilder and AnimationController classes. It creates a container with a text widget that gradually changes opacity over a duration of 2 seconds.

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

The TweenAnimationsEx class extends StatefulWidget and overrides the createState method to create an instance of _TweenAnimationsExState, which is a private class extending State and mixing in SingleTickerProviderStateMixin. The SingleTickerProviderStateMixin is used to provide the vsync parameter for the AnimationController.

In the _TweenAnimationsExState class, the initState method is overridden to set up the animation. It creates an AnimationController with a duration of 2 seconds and assigns it to the _controller variable. The vsync parameter is set to this to provide the ticker provider for the animation.

The _animation variable is initialized as a Tween<double> animation, using Tween to define the range of values for the animation (from 0.0 to 1.0) and animate to bind it to the _controller.

The _controller is then started by calling _controller.forward(), which plays the animation.

In the build method, a Scaffold widget is returned as the root of the widget tree. The body property is set to a Center widget, which centers its child vertically and horizontally.

Within the Center widget, an AnimatedBuilder widget is used to rebuild the UI whenever the animation value changes. The animation property is set to _animation, and the builder property takes a BuildContext and Widget? as arguments. Inside the builder function, a Container is returned with a width and height of 250, a blue background color, and centered alignment.

Inside the Container, an Opacity widget is used to control the opacity of its child based on the animation value. The opacity property is set to _animation.value, and the child is a Text widget with the text "Tween Animations by opacity". The text has a bold font weight, a font size of 20, and a white color.

By running this code, you should see a blue container with the text gradually fading in over a period of 2 seconds.

The given code snippet showcases the use of the TweenAnimationBuilder widget in a Flutter application. This widget facilitates animations by interpolating values between a given range over a specified duration.

The _TweenBuilderAnimationExState class extends StatefulWidget and manages the state of opacity and size properties used for the animations.

In the build method, a Scaffold widget is the main structure of the UI. The body property centers its content using a Center widget. Inside the Center widget, a Column widget is used to vertically stack multiple widgets.

Two instances of TweenAnimationBuilder are used for demonstrating animations. The first TweenAnimationBuilder animates the opacity of a blue container from 0 to 1. It utilizes the Opacity widget to adjust the opacity based on the interpolated value.

The second TweenAnimationBuilder animates the size of a red container from 100 to 200. The width and height of the container are both updated using the interpolated value.

The floatingActionButton triggers changes in the opacity and size values upon being pressed, which in turn initiates the animations. The opacity toggles between 0.0 and 1.0, while the size toggles between 100.0 and 200.0.

By running this code, you can observe how the TweenAnimationBuilder widget simplifies the process of creating animations by interpolating between values, resulting in smoother and visually appealing effects.
